"""cgMLST Hamming distance matrix + MST/NJ tree builder for cohort analysis.

Computes pairwise allele distances between cgMLST profiles and renders a tree
representation suitable for cohort reports (``cgmlst_cohort`` ANALYSIS payload,
downstream of the cohort rules in ``workflows/bacmap/rules/cgmlst.smk``). The
output format mirrors the format-agnostic cohort-summary generator
``workflows/bacmap/scripts/generate_snp_summary.py`` (Newick + pairwise
distances -> JSON), NOT ``generate_snp_matrix.py`` (VCF-specific).

Distance definition (EnteroBase HierCC convention, Zhou 2020):
    d(A, B) = number of loci where BOTH A and B have a non-None allele call
              AND the calls differ. Loci missing on either side (None) are
              excluded from the comparison (not counted as differences, and
              not counted as matches either).

Tree algorithms:
    * ``method="nj"`` (default) -- pure-Python neighbour-joining per Saitou &
      Nei (1987), no external dependency beyond scipy/biopython. Produces an
      unrooted bifurcating tree rendered as Newick. Negative branch lengths
      are clamped to zero (standard practice; e.g. FastTree does the same).
    * ``method="mst"`` -- minimum spanning tree via
      ``scipy.sparse.csgraph.minimum_spanning_tree`` over the complete
      Hamming-weighted graph (Prim's algorithm). Renders the MST as Newick
      by rooting at the first sample and emitting children with their edge
      weights. MST is the canonical layout for cgMLST clustering visualisation
      (GrapeTree default rendering; Zhou 2020).

Both methods produce Newick that round-trips through ``Bio.Phylo.parse``
(biopython 1.87+). The MST path requires scipy (confirmed as a transitive
dependency of sourmash in the pixi env; also available in the dev venv).
